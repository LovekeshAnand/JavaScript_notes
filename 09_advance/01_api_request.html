<!-- The XMLHttpRequest API enables web apps to make HTTP requests to web servers and receive the responses programmatically using JavaScript. This in turn enables a website to update just part of a page with data from the server, rather than having to navigate to a whole new page. This practice is also sometimes known as Ajax. -->
